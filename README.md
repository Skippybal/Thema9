# Membrane composition prediction, using machine learning
This repo contains the log and the weka data used in an experiment for predicting 
membrane composition using various machine learning algoritms.

### How to use ###

To look at the code for generating the log, download the log.rmd and run it using rstudio. 
To look at the pdf of this log, download log.pdf.

The data gathered from weka experiments is stored in the Experiments folder.
In this folder you can find the experiment setups used, and the final results of the experiments.

The dataset used for this experiment isn't in this repo. This is because the dataset isn't publicly 
available. To get access to the data please contact the Hanze Uiversity of Applied Sciences.

### List of needed R libraries ###

Sadly there is no requirements.txt like in python, so you will have to manually download all of the libraries.
